This is a sample React Native project that uses SpaceX launch API.
https://github.com/r-spacex/SpaceX-API

To run the app, run the following command:

```sh
$ npm ci
$ npm run ios
or
$ npm run android
```

For both cases, you need to setup emulator or connect the actual device.

To run the unit tests, run:

```sh
$ npm run test
```
